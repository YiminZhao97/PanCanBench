For Intermediate PS (2), preferred regimens include Gemcitabine + albumin-bound paclitaxel (category 1), Capecitabine, Gemcitabine, 5-FU + leucovorin + oxaliplatin (FOLFOX), 5-FU + leucovorin + irinotecan (FOLFIRI), and CapeOx. For Poor PS (3), Palliative and best supportive care is recommended, though options include Capecitabine (category 2B), continuous infusion 5-FU (category 2B), and Gemcitabine (standard or fixed-dose-rate infusion).
