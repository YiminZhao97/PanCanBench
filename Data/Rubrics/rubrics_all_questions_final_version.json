For patients with BRCA1/2 or PALB2 mutations, preferred options are FOLFIRINOX (category 1 or modified FOLFIRINOX) and Gemcitabine + cisplatin (category 1). Other recommended regimens include Gemcitabine (category 1), Gemcitabine + erlotinib (category 1), Gemcitabine + capecitabine, Gemcitabine + albumin-bound paclitaxel + cisplatin, Fluoropyrimidine + oxaliplatin, CapeOx (category 2B), OFF (category 2B), and GTX (category 2B). For Intermediate PS (2), preferred regimens include Gemcitabine + albumin-bound paclitaxel (category 1), Capecitabine, Gemcitabine, 5-FU + leucovorin + oxaliplatin (FOLFOX), 5-FU + leucovorin + irinotecan (FOLFIRI), and CapeOx. For Poor PS (3), Palliative and best supportive care is recommended, though options include Capecitabine (category 2B), continuous infusion 5-FU (category 2B), and Gemcitabine (standard or fixed-dose-rate infusion). Across all PS groups, therapies useful in certain circumstances include targeted agents: Entrectinib, Larotrectinib, and Repotrectinib (for NTRK gene fusion\u2013positive tumors); Pembrolizumab (for MSI-H, dMMR, or TMB-H \u226510 mut/Mb); Selpercatinib (for RET gene fusion\u2013positive tumors); and Dabrafenib + trametinib (for BRAF V600E mutation\u2013positive cases).
